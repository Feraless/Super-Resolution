# Super-Resolution
This repository contains the implementation of a Super Resolution model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal of this project is to upscale low-resolution images to high-resolution images using deep learning techniques.

## Model Architecture

### Generator
The generator network is responsible for creating high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. It uses a series of convolutional, upsampling, and activation layers to achieve this. The model also integrates subpixel convolution layers to improve the quality of upscaled images.

### Discriminator
The discriminator network distinguishes between real high-resolution images and those generated by the generator. It uses a series of convolutional layers with LeakyReLU activations and dropout for regularization.

## Training

The training loop involves:
1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. Generating fake images using the generator.
3. Calculating the discriminator's loss on real and fake images.
4. Calculating the generator's loss based on the discriminator's feedback.
5. Updating both the generator and discriminator using their respective gradients.
